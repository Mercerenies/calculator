# Calculator

This is a WIP calculator program that I'm working on. More details
here later. But basically, I want a calculator with CAS capabilities
that I will hopefully eventually cross-compile to Android as a working
stack-based app.

Current features are:
 + Basic arithmetic: addition, multiplication, etc.
 + Division by default produces fractions
 + Support for multiple units and functions to convert between them
 + Trig functions support degrees and radians
 + Basic algebraic simplifications
 + Symbolic differentiation of many elementary functions
 + Basic support for vector and matrix arithmetic
