* WHAT TO DO NEXT
** Sept 10, 2019
 + [X] Parse complex numbers
 + [X] Function for converting to "numerical" results (promote
   non-integer ratios to float)
 + [X] Derivatives
 + [X] Simplify ~y / y^2~
 + [ ] (Consider ~D(tan(x)^2, x)~ as a stretch goal)
 + [X] Simplify ~(x^2)^2~
 + [ ] Make floating-points that are actually integers be treated as
   integers for some computations
 + [X] Get rid of the Rank2Types in FunctionType
 + [X] m (Maybe ...) -> MaybeT m ... in FunctionType
** Sept 18, 2019
 + [ ] There may still be some neatening (~mmorph~ style) to be done
   with the FunctionType transition
 + [ ] Symbolic mode
   - [ ] Get rid of fractions if in floating mode
   - [ ] Make ~Normalize.hs~ not depend on ~Function.hs~
   - [ ] If in symbolic mode, hold calculations
   - [ ] Run usual passes into N(...) but forcing into floating mode
 + [ ] Move the primary pass from ~Main.hs~ to ~Normalize.hs~
 + [X] Command line args for mode
