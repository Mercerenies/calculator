* WHAT TO DO NEXT
** Sept 10, 2019
 + [X] Parse complex numbers
 + [X] Function for converting to "numerical" results (promote
   non-integer ratios to float)
 + [X] Derivatives
 + [X] Simplify ~y / y^2~
 + [ ] (Consider ~D(tan(x)^2, x)~ as a stretch goal)
 + [X] Simplify ~(x^2)^2~
 + [X] Make floating-points that are actually integers be treated as
   integers for some computations
 + [X] Get rid of the Rank2Types in FunctionType
 + [X] m (Maybe ...) -> MaybeT m ... in FunctionType
** Sept 18, 2019
 + [X] There may still be some neatening (~mmorph~ style) to be done
   with the FunctionType transition
   - I think we should be good on this. The new FunctionType is
     serving me well.
 + [X] Symbolic mode
   - [X] Get rid of fractions if in floating mode
   - [X] Make ~Normalize.hs~ not depend on ~Function.hs~
   - [X] If in symbolic mode, hold calculations
   - [X] Run usual passes into N(...) but forcing into floating mode
 + [X] Move the primary pass from ~Main.hs~ to ~Normalize.hs~
 + [X] Command line args for mode
 + [-] Trig simplification step
   - [X] The usual trig functions will refuse to evaluate if in
     symbolic mode
   - [X] Write a simplification that solves any "known" trig function
     values exactly
   - [ ] Inverse trig functions as well
   - [ ] Solver for transcendentals as well
   - [ ] Powers?
   - [X] Powers need to not evaluate if they'll produce a floating
     result out of rationals
** Sept 20, 2019
 + [X] Constants
   - [X] Pi
   - [X] e
   - [X] i
** Sept 21, 2019
 + [X] Simplify ~2 * x / 2~
** Sept 22, 2019
 + [ ] Consider how worth it it is to be using Control.Category
   versions of identity and composition and if there's a performance
   hit.
 + [X] Correct parse order for ~/~
 + [-] Unit Arithmetic
   - [X] Generalize the radians / degrees system
   - [ ] Some more standard units
   - [ ] Use the generalized system in ~Data.Calc.Unit.Radians~
   - [X] Basic one-dimensional unit conversion
   - [ ] All of the actual units (in one dimension)
   - [X] Unit synonyms (~L~, etc.)
   - [X] Full higher dimensional units
   - [ ] Be "smart": e.g. if I ask to convert ~m / s^2~ to ~hr~, give
     me ~m / hr^2~.
   - [X] Temperature stuff
   - [X] Move the conversion function to a file ~Data.Calc.Function.Units~
   - [X] Unit simplification
** Sept 25, 2019
 + [ ] Juxtaposition should count as multiplication if it is numbers or variables
